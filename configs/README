This directory contains scripts to reproduce the 'configure' options
that were used when building various components.

config-cross.ssrl was used for
 - autoxxx tools
 - binutils
 - gdb
 - xsyms  ** NOTES **
			'xsyms' resides in the 'src/tools' directory

				cd 'src/tools/xsyms'
				mkdir build-<tgt>-xsyms
				cd build-<tgt>-xsyms
				../../../configs/config-cross.ssrl -t <tgt>
			    make
				make install

 - ldep (this is not a cross but a pure host tool but the script can still handle it)
		build instructions are identical to 'xsyms' (but the target flag is ignored)

****** PROBABLY OBSOLETE BEGIN ******
config-gcc.ssrl is used for the cross-gcc
*NOTE* /opt/rtems/<tgt>-rtems/lib/libiberty.a (installed by gcc install) MUST BE REMOVED; 
       IT CONFLICTS WITH CEXP's libiberty.a. The gcc installed version contains too many
       things (stuff that's already in newlibc and which generates linkage errors).
****** PROBABLY OBSOLETE END ******

config-rtems.ssrl is used for configuring RTEMS
